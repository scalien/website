               ScalienDB vs MongoDB</h1>
            <p class="intro">
                The following critique is based on the MongoDB 2.0 Release Notes.<br />
                While a leader in NoSQL, it is our observation that MongoDB 2.0,<br />
                and many other NoSQL vendors, who claim to be ready for<br />
                mission critical applications for business are really not.
            </p>
            <p class="hl">
                Let's take a look at the key features of MongoDB based on their
                <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/2.0+Release+Notes">Release Notes</a>,
                and compare MongoDB to ScalienDB.</p>
            <!-- <div class="broken-line"></div> -->

                    <h3>Transactions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Here at Scalien we believe transactions are a baseline requirement for a NoSQL database.
                        Without transactions, a NoSQL database is effectively limited to be used as a cache or
                        for storing low importance data like logs. But what do you use for storing mission-critical
                        user data?
                        <br /><br />
                        MongoDB does not support transactions. What it does support is
                        <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Atomic+Operations">atomic updates to single</a>
                        documents, but that is not the same thing as transactions. Real world applications
                        involve updates to several documents.
                        <br /><br />
                        ScalienDB fully supports ACID compliant transactions across keys, the same way an SQL database
                        supports transactions across rows and tables.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Compaction</h3>
                    <p>
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compaction">Data compaction</a> is the reduction of the number of data elements in the database file by
                        throwing away old versions of the data that were overwritten by a newer version. When running
                        MongoDB in production, where lots of data is created, overwritten and deleted, MongoDB requires
                        that the database is periodically
                        <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/compact+Command">compacted</a>.
                        Without compaction, MongoDB eventually uses up
                        all available disk space on the server and cannot accept new data.
                        <br /><br />
                        However, in MongoDB compaction blocks the database and puts it in so-called recovery mode.
                        MongoDB cannot serve reads or writes while compaction is running. To use compaction in
                        production, you will need to run several replicas and juggle the primary server. However,
                        since the MongoDB client does not support failovers like ScalienDB, your application will
                        experience problems because of this, as has been described numerous times, for example 
                        <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8895256/mongodb-maintenance">here</a>.
                        <br /><br />
                        Additionally, since the MongoDB secondary performing compaction is unable to take writes, it will
                        be left behind in the Replica Set while it's compacting, and will have to catch up,
                        potentially causing further problems in production.
                        <br /><br />
                        ScalienDB uses a completely different architecture. In ScalienDB, there is no need for explicit
                        compaction like in MongoDB. Data files in ScalienDB are automatically merged in the background,
                        in a way that does not affect performance and does not block the database. There is no
                        need for juggling the primary like in MongoDB, no problems are introduced to the production database. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>Stack size</h3>
                    <p>
                        This <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/2.0+Release+Notes#2.0ReleaseNotes-DefaultStackSize">improvement</a>
                        is related to the fact that MongoDB creates one thread for each client
                        connection, as mentioned above. With a lot of client connections, you will have a lot of
                        threads, and each thread will take up a fixed amount of memory called "stack space", eating
                        up the server's memory. This is inherent in MongoDB's multi-threaded architecture, which
                        is inferior to ScalienDB's asynchronous event based architecture.
                        <br /><br />
                        In ScalienDB, there is no need to create a new thread for each client connection.  Hence,
                        there is no need for mucking around and understanding stack sizes, or fearing that client
                        connections will eat up the server's memory.

                    <h3>Performance</h3>
                    <p>
                        As has been notes numerous times on the Internet, for example
                        <a href="http://www.colinhowe.co.uk/2011/02/23/mongodb-performance-for-data-bigger-than-memor/">here</a>,
                        MongoDB performance falls off a cliff
                        if your dataset no longer fits into memory. Unfortunately, there is no word in the MongoDB
                        Release Notes about this. We believe this problem is inherent in MongoDB's storage engine
                        architecture and is unlikely to be fixed anytime soon.
                        <br /><br />
                        Unlike MongoDB, ScalienDB uses a linearized storage engine inspired by Google's Bigtable
                        architecture and employs advanced features such as Bloom Filters. Our storage engine is a
                        true Big Data storage engine, allowing you to easily store more data than available RAM
                        without performance falling off a cliff.

                    </p>
                    <h3>Concurrency</h3>
                    <p>
                        <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/How+does+concurrency+work">MongoDB uses a global write lock.</a>
                        This means that under heavy load, as you would have in
                        production, database writes are constantly competing for the global write lock to get their
                        work done. MongoDB 2.0 introduces a fix which decreases this contention by having writes
                        yield the write lock in certain cases. But this does not address the fundamental issue.
                        The problem is that MongoDB uses one thread per client connection, and uses the global
                        write lock to make sure these parallel threads don't cause data corruption.
                        <br /><br />
                        The correct architecture for dealing with 1000s of connections is asynchronous event based
                        networking (kqueue, epoll, Completion Ports), as employed by ScalienDB, where there is no
                        need to create a new thread for each client connection. Hence, in ScalienDB there is no
                        global write lock and no lock contention.
                        <br /><br />
                        In addition, having one thread per connection also means that MongoDB will eat up the server's
                        CPU if running with a lot of clients. In performance tests, connecting 1000s of clients caused
                        MongoDB to eat up all the CPU and essentially stop functioning correctly.
                        <br /><br />
                        Since ScalienDB doesn't create additional threads, even with thousands of active client
                        connections, its usage of CPU and memory on the server is minimal, even under heavy load.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Replica Sets</h3>
                    <p>
                        Replication is both one of the strongest and weakest points of MongoDB. Replication can be
                        fine-tuned by being able to specify how many servers a database write should hit in the
                        Replica Set, what Mongo refers to as a “write concern.“ Additionally, MongoDB 2.0 introduces
                        the ability to tag both servers and writes.
                        <br /><br />
                        In practice, however, using this feature in a way where 2 or more servers have to be hit per
                        write and commit the data to disk, which is a basic requirement for consistency is replication,
                        results in a severe performance decrease in MongoDB.
                        <br /><br />
                        ScalienDB uses a completely different replication scheme called
                        <a href="technology/paxos">Paxos</a>, which guarantees
                        Immediate Consistency. With Paxos, you don't have to worry about things like MongoDB's write
                        concerns. Using Paxos, ScalienDB guarantees that your data is always consistent and available.
